# Hacking-Gender-Bias-Visibility-Box
This Box addresses the Gender Bias of a seemingly objective expert discussion in science. It stresses the problem of underrepresentation of female scientists and their work and displays this visually by the image of an All-Male-Panel. This panel is labeld "Greatest Scientists" and shows Galileo Galilei, Stephen Hawking, Albert Einstein and Erwin Schr√∂dinger. You can look into the box through a small hole in the front side. By switching on the integrated flashlight you are able to see the female scientists, from Marie Curie to Rosalind Franklin, which are shown on the backwall. This project is supposed to reveal preconceptions towards the field of Science and emphasize the outstanding work of female scientists. Even tough this is difficult to notice in our male-dominated system. Therefore, by means of this project I want to (literraly) shed light upon them. And highlight, for all the aspiring students out there, that there are many inspiring female scientists and they could be the next one.
